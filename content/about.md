Hello and welcome to my blog, where I explore data structures and algorithms, design patterns, coding practices, dev tools, libraries, personal projects, and many other things.

I'm a Seattle local, so naturally I enjoy a warm cup of coffee and the rain. I'm a Software Engineer at F5 Networks, developing on the control plane. When I'm not at work, I enjoy reading a variety of books, investing, learning new skills and languages, running Green Lake, hiking in the Cascade mountains, and hanging out with my incredible wife.
